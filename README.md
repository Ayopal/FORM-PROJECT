# FORM_PROJECT
This is a project for web app FORM in registering for jamb, A student can log in to a site, fill the form and by clicking the submit button, All the student's data will be recorded, a printed documents with a number tag (based on first come first serve), time and day to come for registration will be generated and send to the student's email for printing or direct web printing.    [This ease the stress of going to JAMB CENTER without the assurance of being among those that will reg, also helps the Centre manage the numer of students coming for reg with the minimum and maximum regs they can do per day.   Definitely, Those that dont reg online will have a different queue and that is expected to reduce(though not as fast as those whose data the centre already has)}
